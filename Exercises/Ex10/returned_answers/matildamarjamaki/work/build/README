Type of particle detector is being simulated (what materials, approximate geometry);

The GEANT4 example basic/B4/B4a simulates a sampling calorimeter, which is a type of particle detector designed to measure the energy of incoming particles.

In its default configuration, the detector consists of:

- Alternating layers of scintillator and absorber material, forming a layered sandwich-like structure.

- The scintillator layers (usually plastic or inorganic crystal-based) act as the active material that detects energy deposited by the particle showers.

- The absorber layers are made of lead (Pb) by default, and their role is to induce electromagnetic or hadronic showers by slowing down or stopping the incoming particles.

- The geometry includes multiple repeated units (layers) of these materials, arranged in a compact, rectangular geometry typical for calorimeters.

In this simulation, the absorber material was also changed to water to observe how the energy deposition and shower profiles change depending on the absorber material.
