We simulate 1,000,000 events for both signal and background 
samples to ensure a statistically meaningful analysis after 
applying strict kinematic cuts and isolation criteria. 
For rare processes and to estimate the shape of the invariant 
mass distribution reliably in both signal and background, 
at least 10⁵ – 10⁶ events are often needed. This also allows 
us to determine the trigger efficiency with reasonable 
precision.
